# Cypher Coq formalization

This project aims to formalize [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/), a graph query language,
in the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant.
The formalization follows O.H. Morra's paper
["A Semantics of GQL. A New Query Language for Property Graph formalized"](https://github.com/OlofMorra/GQL-parser/blob/main/src/main/resources/report/A%20Semantics%20of%20GQL%3B%20a%20New%20Query%20Language%20forProperty%20Graphs%20Formalized.pdf).

The purpose of the formalization is to make a rigid foundation for further evolution of the language
as well as to provide a framework for verifying optimizations of queries.

## Get the code
